# How the Launchpad Works

Berylbit launch flow is designed to stay consistent while features expand.

## Phase A — Launch / Discovery (Bonding Phase)
A token is launched using defined launch parameters and a transparent mechanism.
Participants can:
- buy / sell during the launch phase
- observe clear, readable rules

## Phase B — Graduation / Migration
Once graduation conditions are reached, the token transitions to external liquidity (or another routing target, depending on phase).

## Phase C — Post-Launch (Live Trading)
After migration, trading is open. The protocol focuses on:
- protecting value from bot extraction
- maintaining fair execution
- enabling creator-aligned revenue mechanisms that are not “user taxes”

## Design Goal
Berylbit aims to align incentives:
- users trade cleanly
- creators benefit from real market activity
- bots have less “free money” to extract
