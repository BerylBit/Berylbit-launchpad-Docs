# Berylbit Launchpad Docs

Berylbit is a Solana-first launchpad designed around one goal:

**0% fees for users — while creators can earn significant revenue from real market activity.**

Berylbit prioritizes:
- fair trading (no hidden spread)
- explicit launch rules (readable mechanics)
- bot-resistance (reduce MEV-style value leakage)
- creator-aligned revenue

> These docs explain the product, the architecture, and the economics at a high level for builders, partners, and investors.
