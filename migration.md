# Migration & Post-Launch Behavior

## What is migration?
Migration (graduation) is the transition from launch-phase mechanics to open-market liquidity.

Berylbit is designed so that:
- migration rules are explicit and readable
- trading becomes open post-migration
- creator revenue mechanisms remain bounded by protocol rules

## Can tokens migrate to other venues?
Yes. Migration targets can include external liquidity or routing venues.

## Will external venues take fees?
Most trading venues have their own fees (LP fees, swap fees, etc.).
Those venue-level fees are separate from Berylbit’s “0% user fees” positioning, which refers to **Berylbit not charging additional taxes/spread** at the protocol layer.

## Why do some tokens pump or dump after migration?
Common reasons:
- liquidity is thin → larger price impact
- bots/arbitrage immediately rebalance pricing
- early holders take profit
- MEV/priority ordering extracts value on volatile pools

Berylbit’s approach focuses on:
- better migration positioning over time
- safer bounded actions
- reducing bot value leakage during key transitions
