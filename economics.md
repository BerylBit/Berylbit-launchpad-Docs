# Economics & Creator Earnings

Berylbit’s core marketing niche:

**0% fees for users — while creators can earn significant revenue from market activity.**

## How can creators earn if users pay 0%?
Traditional platforms charge a user fee per trade.

Berylbit is designed to generate creator revenue from:
- structured market mechanisms
- controlled inventory actions
- value capture that targets bot/extraction flows rather than normal users

> The exact on-chain implementation is enforced by protocol rules and bounded by safety limits.

## Simple Model (High-Level)

Let:
- `V` = volume over a window (USD-equivalent)
- `R` = creator revenue captured by protocol (USD-equivalent)
- `k` = capture ratio (0 to max)

Then:

`R = k * V`

Where `k` is not a “user fee” tax, but a protocol capture ratio bounded by:
- cooldowns
- max impact limits
- minimum volume thresholds
- max per-interval actions

### Example targets
If the protocol captures up to `k = 0.40` in certain ranges and conditions:

- `V = $1,000,000` → `R = $400,000`
- `V = $2,500,000` → `R = $1,000,000`

These are *upper-bound targets* under defined conditions and protections.

## Why this matters
- Creators can fund growth without taxing users
- Projects can sustain development and liquidity efforts
- Users keep clean execution (no hidden spread)
