# What is Berylbit

Berylbit is a launchpad protocol that aims to solve a common problem in token launches:

> Most platforms monetize by charging traders.  
> Berylbit aims to monetize by capturing value from market activity, while keeping user trading clean.

## Key Principles

### 1) 0% user fees
Berylbit does not rely on user taxes or transfer-fee token mechanics. The goal is:
- no buy tax
- no sell tax
- no hidden spread

### 2) Creator-aligned revenue
Creators can earn meaningful revenue as a function of real trading activity (volume), with configurable safeguards so the mechanism is not destructive.

### 3) Readable mechanics
Launch configuration is treated as “launch facts”:
- supply decisions are explicit
- graduation rules are explicit
- optional mechanics are explicit

### 4) Built for bot-heavy markets
MEV/bot extraction is a major reason many charts die after launch. Berylbit is designed to reduce value leakage and protect project momentum.

## Who is it for?
- Creators: earn without taxing users
- Traders: fair fills, no hidden spread
- Builders/Partners: integrate via SDK, build UI/analytics/keepers
