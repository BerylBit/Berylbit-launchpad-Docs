# FAQ

## Is this a pump.fun clone?
No. Pump.fun is a reference for distribution speed. Berylbit focuses on 0% user fees, creator revenue from market activity, and bot-resistance.

## If users pay 0% fees, who pays?
No one is directly “taxed” per trade. Creator revenue is designed to be captured from market activity with bounded actions and safety constraints.

## Is the core open source?
No. Core protocol logic is private and enforced on-chain. The SDK is public for integration.

## When public launch?
Staged rollout. Builders can integrate now; public launch follows after phased readiness.
